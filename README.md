## 📅 Week 1 Progress *(Held on: 25/02/2025)*  
### ✅ Tasks Completed:  
1. **Dataset Selection & Preparation**  
   - Used the **[New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data)** from Kaggle, contributed by *Samir Bhattarai*.  
   - Downloaded and extracted the dataset using `kagglehub`.  

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**  
   - Installed essential libraries: `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, etc.  
   - Configured Jupyter Notebook for project development.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized sample images from the dataset.  
   - Analyzed class distribution (healthy vs. diseased plants).  

4. **Notebook File Added:**  
   - `Week-1/PlantDiseaseDetection_.ipynb`

## 📅 Week 2 Progress (Held on: 04/03/2025)
### ✅ Tasks Completed:

1. **Data Augmentation & Preprocessing**
   - Applied image transformations (rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance model generalization.
   - Improved dataset balance by generating additional training samples.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted key features from images to improve classification accuracy.
   - Analyzed the impact of color histograms and texture features on disease detection.
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Experimented with different CNN architectures to find the best-performing model.
   - Implemented hyperparameter tuning (batch size, learning rate) for optimal performance.
4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Analyzed accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices to fine-tune predictions.
   - Compared training vs. validation performance to detect overfitting.
5. **Notebook File Added:**
   - `Week-2/PlantDiseaseDetection_week_2_.ipynb`
6. **Generated Files:** (Since these files are bigger in size (more than 25 MB) they can be uploaded)
   - `best_model.keras`
   - `CNN_Model.keras`
