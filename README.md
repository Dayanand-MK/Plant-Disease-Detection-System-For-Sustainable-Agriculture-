## 📅 Week 1 Progress *(Held on: 25/02/2025)*  
### ✅ Tasks Completed:  
1. **Dataset Selection & Preparation**  
   - Used the **[New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data)** from Kaggle, contributed by *Samir Bhattarai*.  
   - Downloaded and extracted the dataset using `kagglehub`.  

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**  
   - Installed essential libraries: `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, etc.  
   - Configured Jupyter Notebook for project development.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized sample images from the dataset.  
   - Analyzed class distribution (healthy vs. diseased plants).  

4. **Notebook File Added:**  
   - `Week-1/PlantDiseaseDetection_.ipynb`
